# Time-Reader
A console-based Windows program that will display a text file at a user-specified word-per-minute rate

The intended purpose of this program is for helping machine shorthand students create their own dictation for learning and practice.

This program will open a window and request a text file name. (It expects the file to be in the 
same directory as the executable.) Once that's entered it will ask for a word per
minute rate. After that it will count down from five and then begin to display the text file one word at a time
at the chosen rate. Any keypress will pause the playback. A few stats are shown at the end.

Instructions:
  1. Download and extract the folder from the .zip file.
  2. Double-click on the Time Reader application.
  3. When prompted give the name of the text file to use.
  4. Enter the desired word-per-minute rate and the program will start.
