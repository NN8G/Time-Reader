Display text file at specific word-per-minute rate

This program will open a window and request a text file name. Once that's entered it will ask for a word per
minute rate. After that it will count down from five and then begin to display the text file one word at a time
at the chosen rate. Any keypress will pause the playback. A few stats are shown at the end.
